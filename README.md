# Foreign-Object-Detection-in-X-Rays
This repository concludes our work on a foreign object detector in X-Ray images as students in TAU, as part of a course in Deep Learning, and as participants in the competition: https://jfhealthcare.github.io/object-CXR/.

The goal of the competition was to create an object detector, that could be used to ease the process of X-Ray analysis.
